Physical address: Is the address that exists in the main memory (actual place to save data). they are limited by the size of actual memory installed. The user has no access to physical addresses. only The MMU accesses them.
	

Virtual address: Is "fake" or "indirect" address generated by the CPU which then get mapped to a physical "real" address in memory. They are usually there to make the user he has more memory than the physical memory. and the user can access virtual addresses without restrictions.
